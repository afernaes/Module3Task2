General Comment:
Very good work for ggplot and hypothesis testing.
Clean code. Try for next time to upload usefull code only, you can
have two version : test and final.

Congrat !

Line 74/76 ---> Relative path needed
Line 134/135 ---> Can add captation in Ggplot to keep track of plots
Line 138 ---> Miss the plus at the end of the line (title did not appear)
Line 157/158 ---> Same, miss the + at the end of the line
